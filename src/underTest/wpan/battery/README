BasicBattery: Implementation of a simple battery model
    "real" battery models should subclass this! 
 	The basic class publishes the remaining energy on the blackboard,
 	but does not decrement the energy. It can therefore be used for hosts 
    having an infinite energy supply i.e. a power plug

SensorBattery: Battery class to be used together with the 802.11 MAC.
    The model accounts for energy usage due to radio transmissions and
    receptions, cpu consumption (based on radio activity), and additional
    cpu consumptions based on varying sensor programs (changes in sensor
    programs are received via the notification board)

SmacBattery: Battery class to be used together with the SMAC.
    The model accounts for energy usage due to radio transmissions and
    receptions and cpu consumption based on radio activity
