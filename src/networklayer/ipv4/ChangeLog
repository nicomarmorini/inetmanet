	* IP: set timeToLive to 1 if the destination is isLinkLocalMulticast() to
        prevent broadcasting to non-neighbouring routers.

	* RoutingTable: implemented routing cache [code based on OverSim 
	patch]; similar performance optimization for isLocalAddress()

	* IP: performance: remember outputQueue gate pointer instead of 
	looking up the gate by name for each send(). Note: could do the
	same optmization for other gates as well, but this gate is much 
	more often used than the others

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

	* introduced IRoutingTable, to allow users implement their own 
	RoutingTables and plug them into INET simulations, without any 
	change to the base INET.

	* RoutingTable: properly fire notifications on routing table changes

2008-07-01  Andras Varga

	* wrapped naked data members of IPv4Route into getters/setters

	* RoutingTable: enforce by returning "const" pointers that routes 
	already added cannot be changed any more (one must delete and 
	re-add it)

	* IP: factored out a createIPDatagram method

	* IP.cc: obey new "outputPort" field of IPControlInfo when sending
	multicast datagram

	* RoutingTableParser.cc: 5th field of a route in routing files is
	the metric (so far it was "preferences" but in fact it was unused)

2005-07-06  Andras Varga

	* IP.cc: don't forward "link-local" multicast addresses (224.0.0.x)

2005-07-04  Andras Varga

	* RoutingTable: localDeliver() ignores interface netmask [reported by
	Michael Tuexen]
	
	* RoutingTable: interface netmask functionality is now achieved by 
	routes of type IFACENETMASK added to the routing table. These routes
	are re-build whenever notification is received that there was a change
	in the interface IPv4 configurations.
