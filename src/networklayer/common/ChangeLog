	* introduced IInterfaceTable, to allow users implement their own 
	InterfaceTables and plug them into INET simulations, without any 
	change to the base INET.

	* created this package, by moving files from contract/

	* InterfaceEntry: setter methods made virtual. This has near zero
	performance cost (calls to setters are rare, and the class already
	has a vptr due to cObject). Also added backpointer to containing
	InterfaceTable.

	* InterfaceTable: implemented NotificationBoard-based notifications 
	about interface changes: NF_INTERFACE_CREATED, NF_INTERFACE_DELETED, 
	NF_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGED, NF_INTERFACE_CONFIG_CHANGED. 
	The detail object for all four are the InterfaceEntry.

	* InterfaceTable: created a getInterfaceById() method, NOT to be 
	confused with getInterface(pos)! Ids are stable after deletions,
	unlike 0..getNumInterfaces()-1 indices


	TODO: changes to protocol-specific interface data (IPv4, IPv6)
	don't trigger a notification yet
