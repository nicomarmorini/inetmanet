	* EtherMAC2: refactored to use cGate::getDatarateChannel()

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

	* removed utils.h/cc: no longer needed with OMNeT++ 4.0 (which has 
	built-in message IDs, message tree IDs and sequence chart 
	visualization)

	* EtherMAC2: performance: only fire notifications if someone is listening

	* EtherMAC2: made notification consistent with PPP: use TxDetails as
	"details" object

	* EtherMAC, EtherMAC2: performance: remember output gate pointer 
	instead of looking it up for each send()

	* moved class declarations from .cc files into separate .h files 
	  for EtherHub, EtherLLC, EtherEncap, etc

	* created EtherMAC2, which is a simplified, duplex-only version of
 	  EtherMAC (i.e. it does not contain the CSMA/CD algorithm)

	* EtherMAC: auto MAC address assignment

	* EtherMAC: auto-configuration of transmission rate and duplex/half duplex i
	  mode.

	* it's no longer an error if EtherMAC is not connected to the network 
	  ("unplugged cable")

	* elaboration of Ethernet frame types: Ethernet II, 802.3 with LLC,
	  802.3 with LLC and SNAP.

	* added EtherEncap, which does encapsulation/decapsulation with
	  Ethernet II frames.

	* communication between LLC and higher layers changed: now it uses
	  controlInfo() as introduced in OMNeT++ 3.0

	* PAUSE handling fixed: PAUSE frames to be sent have now priority
	  in the MAC (they overtake normal frames in the queue).
	  MACRelayUnits: minimal time interval introduced that must elapse
	  before sending another PAUSE frame.

	* new example network: models a very large Ethernet LAN. Ini files
	  for old example networks available in test/ subdir.

	* sample application changed to EtherAppCli+EtherAppSrv. EtherAppCli
	  sends requests of at configurable intervals to EtherAppSrv.
	  Each request contains how many bytes EtherAppSrv should send back
	  in response. If this number is 0, no frames are sent; if it is
	  larger than ~1500, several frames are sent back.

	* Various fixes on the switch model:
	- address table reading was broken
	- fixed bug in MACRelayUnitNP and PP (referencing a deleted message)
	- fixed crash at removing aged entries from table
	- zero addressTableSize to mean unlimited table
	- table management: if table full, throw out oldest entry
