// A generic bus model.
//
// The ethg[i] gates represent taps. Messages arriving on a tap
// travel on the bus on both directions, and copies of it are sent out
// on every other tap after delays proportional to their distances.
//
// Tap connections should have zero delays and zero data rates!
//
// Messages are not interpreted by the bus model in any way, thus the bus
// model is not specific to Ethernet in any way. Messages may
// represent anything, from the beginning of a frame transmission to
// end (or abortion) of transmission.
