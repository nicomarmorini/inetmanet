 * Small-scale fading & multipath model:

 * You can also set the normalized doppler frequecy (DopplerFrequency / SymbolRate)
 * Cases NOT covered:
 * The channel models a slow flat fading channel, i.e. the channel is neither frequency-selective,
 * nor of fast fading type. Please refer to the accompanying documentation for more info.
