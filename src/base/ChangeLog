	* ModuleAccess: use findModuleWhereverInNode() instead of
        findModuleSomewhereUp. It goes up in the hierarchy up to
        to @node module and search inside them recursively.

	* NotificationBoard: added bool hasSubscribers(int category) method.
	By using a local boolean 'hasSubscriber' flag, it allows performance-
	critical clients to leave out calls to fireChangeNotification() if 
	there's no one subscribed anyway. The flag should be refreshed on 
	each NF_SUBSCRIBERLIST_CHANGED notification (newly added too).

	* INotifiable: receiveChangeNotification() signature change: details
	object pointer became "const"

	* NotifierConsts: added constants for overlay networks [from Ingmar 
	Baumgart, OverSim]

	* AbstractQueue improved so that if serviceTime is zero, it does not
	  schedule a timer but sends out the message (i.e. invokes endService())
	  immediately

	* added FSMA.h (written by Levente Meszaros for the IEEE802.11 model)
