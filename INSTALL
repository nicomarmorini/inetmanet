INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The INET Framework can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 4.0 or later.

1. Make sure your OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (to test, try the command "which nedtool").

2. Change to the INET directory.

3. Type "make" to build the inet executable (debug version). Use "make MODE=release" 
   to build release version.

That should be it.

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change into examples/ and type
"./rundemo".

Note:
-----
If you add/remove files/directories later in the src directory, you should regenerate 
your makefile in the src directory with:

opp_makemake -f --deep --make-so -o inet -O out

If you are using the IDE, it will do it for you. You don't have to do anything.
